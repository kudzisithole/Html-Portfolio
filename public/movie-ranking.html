<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<h3>About time</h3>
<p>
    This is a good rom-com with a bit of time travel in it, 
    its good to watch on a wet Sunday afternoon.
</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>
    The entire series captures the struggles of an abandoned
    kid who goes on a journey with the weight of an entire 
    world on his shoulders at the same time struggling to 
    juggle growing up and school as well.
</p>
<h3>The Hobbit</h3>
<p>
    A great adventure movie that encapsulates the hero's
    journey focusing on bilbo baggins a hobit in the shire
    helping a group of dwarfs claim their home.
